        This exhibition features works by artists who use musical elements to enhance the viewer's experience, by exploring beyond the limits of web designs. 
        The visuals incorporated in these projects are aesthetically pleasing, as the artists use unconventional graphics to express their desired message 
        for the art piece. Each piece explores key themes such as users, relationships, cultural history, musical expression, and feminism. 
        Most of the works were created between the late 1990s to early 2000s, a period that influenced Cyber-Feminine Club which plays a pivotal 
        role in the project Station Radio, Season 4's. This era also highlights how an artist's ability to explore beyond the web's potential led 
        to technological advances that continue to shape the digital world today. By creating online musical projects, artists are able to reach diverse 
        audiences, using music, a universal language, to take users on an emotional journey. Such projects offer artists endless creative freedom to evolve 
        with the trends of the society and express themselves in innovative ways.
